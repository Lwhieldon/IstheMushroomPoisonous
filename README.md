## Overview

Is it possible to tell if a mushroom is poisonous or not just by its physical characteristics? In this project, I explore using classification algorithms to predict if a mushroom is edible or will lead to certain death!

This dataset and project derived from the <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification/version/1>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a> on kaggle. 

## Deliverables:

This assignment contains 3 primary areas:
