    "Mushrooms (a.k.a. Fungi) have a multitude of uses for humankind. From medicine, food, and even for esoteric uses like packaging & biofuel, fungi have the potential to unlock biological material that's considered a 'waste product' in our civilization and convert it into something else entirely useful. Small business communities of mushroom foragers are now more than ever seeing a rise in the interest of fungi throughout the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will pretend that I am a data scientist hired by a business community of local mushroom foragers in Oregon and they need my help to build out a better process to identify if mushrooms are poisonous or edible; they have a bunch of 'young' fungi foragers who need a little help!\n",

    "I compare different machine learning classification models to find the one with the best performance: k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Preceptron techniques. In discovery, I conclude that....\n"
